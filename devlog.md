### Sept 14th:

Summary Upto this point:

- mostly have worked on the UI. 
- Have designed a numbering system for the board. 
- Implemented a smaller board (4x4) for testing, with UI for two players.
- Lost a few days of development, becaues I spent quite a bit of time on App School - learning about subscriptions, pokes and scries for basic agents.
    - I fell behind a week because I was thinking of things to do for the hackathon. I aim to have the App School Notes+homework started by Thursday, and finished by Sunday to keep up.
- Will continue on UI work, and learning an App School Tutorial (FlappyBird). This cointains relevent information for my backend.
- At the moment, the focus will be on the UI as I learn the backend stuff more.
- Will also need some rudimentary testing for my UI. Playwright.js for this?
- Might need Next/Express.js to make the FE <-> Gall requests a bit more simple to process.
- Overall development process: Focus on UI first, and switch more to backend and testing as the weeks go on.
